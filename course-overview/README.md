# Important Notes
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

> We are authors:
- Writing as a profession
- We construct documents and system
- Creators of a theory or a plan

> Each line is read 10+ time

## Clean code principles

### Right tool for the job
Stay native: do not use other language syntax as string. One language per file.

### High signal to noise ratio
Rule of seven:
- Parameters per method
- Methods in class
- Variables in current scope
- Dependencies in constructor(?)

### Self-documenting
